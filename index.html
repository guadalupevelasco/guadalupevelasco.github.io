        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Guadalupe Velasco and I attend the University of California Riverside. As of now I am currently undeclared as my major but have found interest in pursuing a bachelor's degree in Education or Sociology. These are both fields that I feel confident and strongly in pursuing.If I were to major in any of the two options listed I would either go into social work or become a teacher for Elementary students. I believe that I am able to get along well with kids. I easily demonstrate patience,understanding, and communicative skills. These are great skills that are needed in order to understand young children. I believe that they would need someone who would pay attention to them carefully and I would be able to do that in either of the settings.In the summer I hope to take summer courses that will expand my knowledge on what these education have to offer and declare my major this fall.<br><br>

        I attended Theodore Roosevelt High school, which is located in Los Angeles in a small community named Boyle Heights, where I was raised. Throughout my time at school I participated in multiple extracurriculars and took part in many programs that were offered. Some of these were college track, Telacu Upward Bound, and Altamaed. I see all of these programs for that additional support in my education. They open more doors for me and an opportunity to earn scholarships. I also took part in two sports such as SRLA and Track & Field.Lastly in my junior year of high school I was able to take a psychology course at my local community college, which was free and consisted of many benefits. I would say I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent at this school and made memorable experiences.
<br><br>

       Although I have not acquired a job yet I have had multiple volunteer experiences. Some of these include volunteering at church, SRLA, and the boys and girls club. Helping out others in any way I can has been something I always wanted to do therefore volunteering is something I enjoy. To expand more on what each of these organizations are I will explain a little further what they are and what my role was. SRLA stands for student run los angeles, it is an organization that serves students in a running program, they gather volunteers to hand out metals, water, and snacks at the end of the finish line. My role consisted of handing out snacks and water at the end of the finish line. At the boys and girls club I spent my time with an after school program where we would assist the youth. This could be helping them with their homework or even supervising them, making sure nothing went wrong. This is one place I would go 2 out of the 5 weekdays when I got out of school, usually from 3-6pm.Lastly I have taken the time to volunteer at my local church called our lady of lourdes, in this place we collected donations and helped seat people down .
